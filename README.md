# Sepsis Early Warning Dashboard (Educational v1)

This project is an educational web-based dashboard designed to teach healthcare students and professionals about the early warning signs of sepsis using the qSOFA (Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score.

The dashboard simulates different patient scenarios to demonstrate how changes in vital signs and lab results can indicate a rising risk of sepsis.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Dynamic Status Updates:** The main status card changes color and text based on the calculated risk.
- **qSOFA Score Calculation:** Automatically calculates and displays the qSOFA score based on patient vitals.
- **Clear Data Visualization:** Presents patient information, vitals, and lab results in easy-to-read cards.
- **Interactive Scenarios:** Buttons allow users to load different patient profiles (Normal, At-Risk, Sepsis Alert) to see the dashboard in action.
- **Heart Rate Trend:** Includes a simple chart to visualize the patient's heart rate over the last few hours.
- **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and bundled with Webpack.
